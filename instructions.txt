2. If that doesn't work you can use the following steps:

1. Load bbcsport folder to home directory of sandbox root user
2. hadoop fs -put bbcsport/ to put on HDFS
3. pyspark --master local[P], where P is number of available processors for your machine
4. after Spark console has started, copy/paste line 1-9 of full_code_final.py
5. In line 9, adjust the shuffle partitions to equal previous value of P
6. copy/paste all three function out of full_code_final.py (build_index,load_index,query_call)
7. Once they successfully load, copy/paste and run each of the subsequent blocks individually
8. Build index (with choice of folder) lines 64-69
9. Load index (with same choice of folder in step 8) lines 71-83
10. Queries, lines 85-EOF, with line break inbetween.
